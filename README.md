# azuretools

Repo of scripts used with AzureCLI/Powershell to extract or audit information within a tenant as there appears to be no functionality
from Microsoft currently to parse through all Subscriptions and Resource groups to gather this information on an automated basis.

Each script contains a comment at the top as a brief readme on its functions and any other points of note.
